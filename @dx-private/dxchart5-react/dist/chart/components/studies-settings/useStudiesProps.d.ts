 * The hook is used to create method and properties for studiesSettings popup.
 * Returns an object that contains the following properties:
 *
 * - onClose: a function that closes the studies popup and calls the onClose function from studiesProps.
 *
 * - onConfigure: a function that opens the studies popup, sets popupOpened state to true,
 * and calls the onConfigureStudy function from studiesProps with the uuid argument.
 *
 * - onOpen: a function that opens the studies popup if the onOpen function is defined in studiesProps.
 *
 * - settingsBtnRef: a reference to a HTMLButtonElement that is used to trigger the studies popup.
 *
 * - isOpened: a boolean that determines whether the studies popup should be opened or closed.
 * This is determined by the popupOpened state and the isOpened property from studiesProps.
 * two varriables is used  because if studiesProps.isOpened === true,
 * then in all places where this hook is used studies popup will be open,
 * so we need to incapsulate opening in target component with 'popupOpened' value
